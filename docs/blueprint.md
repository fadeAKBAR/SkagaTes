## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calm teal (#4DB6AC) to foster trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F0F2F5), to create a clean, distraction-free environment.
- Accent color: Use a complementary amber (#FFB300) to highlight actionable items and important metrics.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear, modern readability.
- Use clear and simple icons from a library like FontAwesome, particularly star icons for the rating input. Consistency is key across the application.
- Implement a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS to ensure optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices. Use clear divisions and spacing to avoid clutter.
- Subtle animations such as fade-ins or slide-ins when new data loads, or gentle highlighting effects on interactive elements.
